TASK PRACTICE

I created a program to create tasks and get an idea of ​​any tasks I need to complete.

It has a module to create a task with a title, description, and completed task.
The task list has two buttons: one to delete and one to update a task that has already been completed.


The command to execute the backend is:
````npm run start````

And the command to execute the frontend is:
````npm run dev````
